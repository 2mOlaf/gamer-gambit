# Working Directory Status - Essential Files Restored

The following operational files have been restored:

✅ secrets.yaml - Your working secrets file (from template)
✅ deploy-secrets.ps1 - Deploy secrets to Kubernetes
✅ deploy.ps1 - Manual deployment script  
✅ deployment-local.yaml - Local deployment configuration
✅ pvc-commands.md - PVC management commands
✅ update-secrets.ps1 - Secret update utility
✅ .gitignore - Protects your working files from being committed

These files are git-ignored and safe to modify locally for your deployment needs.

Quick verification:
- Test-Path 'secrets.yaml'  # Should be True
- git status --ignored      # Should show secrets.yaml as ignored
- kubectl get secrets -n gamer-gambit  # Should show your deployed secrets
